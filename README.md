## Getting Started

In order to communicate with YouTube's Data API, you will need to provide an API KEY.

The application will get the key from the .env variable NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY.

After providing an API key, you can simply do

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Run local:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your machine will host the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
